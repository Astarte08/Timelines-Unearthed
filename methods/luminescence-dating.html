        <h3>What is Luminescence Dating?</h3>
        <p>Luminescence dating is a technique that determines when mineral grains were last exposed to sunlight or heat. It involves a group of methods that measure the amount of trapped energy in minerals like quartz and feldspar. This energy accumulates over time due to exposure to natural radiation from the environment (e.g., uranium, thorium, potassium). When the minerals are exposed to sunlight or heat, the energy is released, resetting the “clock.”</p>
        <p>Common types of luminescence-dating include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Thermoluminescence (TL):</strong> Used to date ceramics, burnt flint, and sediments that have been heated in the past. It measures the light emitted from a sample when it is heated.</li>
          <li><strong>Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL):</strong> Used to date sediments that were last exposed to sunlight. It measures the light emitted when the sample is stimulated with light in the laboratory.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How is it conducted?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sample Collection:</strong> Sediments or artifacts are carefully collected in light-proof containers to avoid resetting the luminescence signal.</li>
          <li><strong>Laboratory Preparation:</strong> In the lab, mineral grains are isolated and cleaned and then the sample is placed in a controlled environment to measure its luminescence.</li>
          <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> The sample is exposed to heat (TL) or light (OSL), this releases stored energy as photons (light), which are measured using sensitive detectors.</li>
          <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> Scientists calculate the radiation dose the sample received over time. The age is calculated using the formula: <ul>Age
=
Total stored dose
/Annual dose rate</ul> This gives the time since the sample was last exposed to light or heat.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why is it useful?</h3>
        <p>luminescence-dating is ideal for dating prehistoric sites with no organic remains, it works on inorganic materials like sediments and ceramics helping archaeologists to study historical human activities. It extremely useful as it dates events beyond radiocarbon limits (up to hundreds of thousands of years).</p>
