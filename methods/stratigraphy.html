        <h3>What is Stratigraphy?</h3>
        <p>Stratigraphy is the study of layered deposits (strata) that accumulate over time, helping archaeologists understand the chronological sequence of human activity and natural events at a site.
          It involves analyzing the layers of soil and artifacts found at excavation sites. Each layer, or stratum, represents a specific period of time and can provide insights into the activities that occurred during that time.
          The principle of stratigraphy is based on the law of superposition, which states that in undisturbed layers, the oldest layers are at the bottom and the youngest are at the top. This allows archaeologists to establish a relative chronology of events and artifacts</p>
        <h3>How is it conducted?</h3>
        <p>Archaeologists excavate sites layer by layer, documenting soil composition, artifacts, and features in each stratum.
          Excavation methods are heavily influenced by stratigraphic principles. Archaeologists carefully document the layers they uncover, noting the depth and context of each find.</p>
        <h3>Why is it useful?</h3>
        <p>It helps establish a relative timeline of human activity and environmental change, by studying the stratigraphy of a site, archaeologists can gain insights into the cultural practices, environmental conditions, and historical events that shaped human activity over time.
          Stratigraphy is a crucial tool in archaeology that helps researchers piece together the history of human activity through the careful study of layered deposits at excavation sites. It provides a framework for understanding the chronological order of events and the relationships between different artifacts and layers.</p>
