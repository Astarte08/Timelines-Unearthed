        <h3>What is Electron-spin-resonance?</h3>
        <p>Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) dating is a technique that measures trapped electrons in materials like tooth enamel, coral, and cave deposits to determine their age.
          It involves the principle that natural radiation from the environment causes electrons to become trapped in defects within crystal lattices of certain materials. These trapped electrons accumulate over time.
          When exposed to a magnetic field and microwave radiation in a laboratory, the trapped electrons resonate at specific frequencies, known as electron spin resonance.
          The intensity of this resonance signal is proportional to the number of trapped electrons, which in turn reflects the time elapsed since the material was last exposed to heat or sunlight (which would have reset the electron traps).
        </p>
        <h3>How is it conducted?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sample Collection:</strong> Samples such as tooth enamel, corals, shells and quartz grains are carefully collected from archaeological or geological sites. Samples must be carefully collected to avoid exposure to light or heat that could reset the signal.</li>
          <li><strong>Laboratory Preparation:</strong> The samples are cleaned and prepared in the laboratory to isolate the material of interest (e.g., enamel from teeth). The sample is then placed in a magnetic field and exposed to microwave radiation.</li>
          <li><strong>Signal Detection:</strong> The ESR spectrometer detects the resonance signal produced by trapped electrons. The strength of the signal indicates the accumulated radiation dose.</li>
          <li><strong>Dose Rate Calculation:</strong> The environmental radiation dose rate at the sample site is calculated, considering factors like cosmic radiation and surrounding sediment radioactivity.</li>
          <li><strong>Age Calculation:</strong> The age of the sample is calculated using:</li>
          <ul>Age
=
Total absorbed dose
/Annual dose rate</ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why is it useful?</h3>
        <p> It can date materials up to 2 million years old, extending beyong radiocarbon limits.
          It ideal for for early human sites, especially in caves where teeth and bones are preserved.
          It is also useful in paleoanthropology, especially for dating hominin fossils and associated fauna.
